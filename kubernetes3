		replication controller ensures high availability, we need replication controller to create multiple pods to share the load across them
		
		replication controller spans across multiple nodes
		
		replication controller is the older technology, replica set is the latest one, selector is the major difference between the replication controller and the replica set
		
		
		
		
		The role of replication controller is to monitor the pods and deploy the new pod if anything is failed
		
		
		how does the replica set know what are the pods it needs to be monitored
		
		command for updating replica set
		kubectl replace -f replicaset-definition.yml
		
		to scale replicaset-definition
		
		kubectl scale --replicas=6 -f replicaset-definition.yml
		
		kubectl scale --replicas=6 -f replicaset  myapp-replicaset
	
		
		to create a replica set
		
		kubectl create -f replicaset-definition.yml
		
   to get a list of replica set
   
   kubectl get replicaset
   
   to delete a replica set
   
   kubectl delete replicaset myapp-replicaset(also deletes all underlying pods)
