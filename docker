To pull and run any  image with its latest version

docker run tomcat:latest


docker container run -idt nginx:latest


do ifconfig to find the ip adresss of the docker host

docker system info
docker system events
docker container run alpine unama -a
docker ps -n 2
docker container run -it alpine sh

A docker file is a set of instructions that tells docker how to build your container image

Docker file syntax

FROM image-name:tag

ADD some-file-on-host some-path-inside-container

COPY some-file-on-host some-path-inside-container

using ADD and COPY to load your container with required files


use RUN to execute commands within container


CMD["" ""]

use CMD as an entry point command to initially launch your application such as "catalina.sh run"

VOLUME some-folder-within-the-container

use VOLUME to map container folders to a host machine folder.

WORKDIR some-folder-within-the-container

use WORKDIR to switch between folders within the container as you execute ADD, COPY, RUN commands as needed.

you need to keep your container host independent which means you can specify host file in docker file


docker run -itd --name -p 3001:2368 ghost:alpine

docker logs ghost

docker image history ghost:latest

docker container run -idt --name dev-ubuntu --net host ubuntu bash

to go in to ubuntu, 

https://vsupalov.com/

to to inside a container

docker exec -it containerid /bin/bash

docker exec -it dev-ubuntu bash

docker cp

touch testfile

docker container cp testfile stupefied_name:/opt

docker diff containerid

you need to stp the container and remove the container
if you want to remove use it forcefully use -f
