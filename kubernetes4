To edit a pod

kubectl edit pod podname

controllers - Brain behind kubernetes, they are the processes that monitor kubernetes objects and monitor accordingly

Even if you have a single pod, replication controller can bring up the new pod, when the existig pod goes down

Replication controller ensures the specified number of pods are running all time, even if it is just 1 or 100

another reason we need replication controller to create multiple pods to share the load across them.

If the resources are running out of the node, it can bring up the pod on the newer node

Replicaset is the newer one

spec: Defines what is inside the object that we are creating.

Replication controller create multiple instances of a pod

template and replicas are children of spec

kubectl get replicationcontroller


kubectl create -f replication-controller.yml

kubectl get pods

for replicaset apiVersion:apps/v1

other diff is replicaset has selector label, the selector helps the replica set to identify what pods fall under it


editing  a replicaset/ scaling replicas

kubectl create  -f replicaset-defintion.yml

kubectl scale --replicas=6 replicaset-defintion.yml

kubectl scale --replicas=6 replicaset myapp-replicaset
