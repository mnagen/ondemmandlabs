1)>>>   ***The first step in building an aplication is compiling it***

                        mvn compile

           maven will compile the java source code to class files


2)>>> After maven compile, we ll do maven test, if there are any tests associated with project

                          mvn test

         once you run the maven test, we can see the results

       how many tests were run, failures, errors, skipped, mainly you'll see the build was successfull


3)>>> ::package phase:: in package phase, mvn will generate a jar or war file, you can find this it in the target folder


After testing our application, you can do the packaging,in .net, we have Nunit to ren tests, Nuget to package
